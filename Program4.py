#Building the AdaBoost Model
#Let's create the AdaBoost Model using Scikit-learn. AdaBoost uses Decision Tree Classifier as default Classifier.

# Create adaboost classifer object
abc = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50,
                         learning_rate=1)
# Train Adaboost Classifer
model = abc.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Predict the response for test dataset
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)


# Model Accuracy, how often is the classifier correct?
print("Accuracy:",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
